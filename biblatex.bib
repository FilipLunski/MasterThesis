  abstract = {Deep learning has become an area of interest to the researchers in the past few years. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning approach that is widely used for solving complex problems. It overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. The motivation of this study is to provide the knowledge and understanding about various aspects of CNN. This study provides the conceptual understanding of CNN along with its three most common architectures, and learning algorithms. This study will help researchers to have a broad comprehension of CNN and motivate them to venture in this field. This study will be a resource and quick reference for those who are interested in this field.},

﻿@article{McCulloch1943,
  abstract = {Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The history of neural networks can be traced back to the work of trying to model the neuron. Today, neural networks discussions are occurring everywhere. Neural networks, with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data, can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques. A brief history of the neural networks research is presented and some more popular models are briefly discussed. The major attention is on the feed-forward networks and specially to the topology of such the network and method of building the multi-layer perceptrons.},
